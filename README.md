# What is it
This is a tentacle rig for Maya based on my rigging system called Rigpp. The rig is mostly for testing purposes to gather feedbacks, bugs and crashes from users.

This rig evaluates an LLVM bitcode with a tentacle rig written in C++. No dependencies required, the module is in the MA file itself. 

## How to open
Use **Maya 2023.2**. Load rigpp.mll before openning the scene. Skip an initial message informing to set RIGPP_RUNTIME environment variable.

**It won't work in any other Maya versions!** (like 2019, 2022)

## Features
Auto tangents, pins, twists, squash, auto swinging (waving), reverse.

All the available attributes are on the controls. 

## Work in progress
Roll from any position, custom control number, dynamic IK/FK, dynamic parent.

## Feedback
Any feedback is welcome via email, telegram, linkedin, github.
